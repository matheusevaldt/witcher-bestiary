Igni can be used to light the bear on fire, which will temporarily stun it and allow you to move in for flanking strikes. Yrden can be used to slow the bear down just enough to make it easier on you to evade their paws.",

            "Venomous arachasae can be fought using the same strategies and tactics as regular arachasae. The main difference is the creature's venom, which makes the usage of the Golden Oriole potion a necessity for neutralising the potent poison.",
            "Like other members of this species, venomous arachasae use prehensile feelers to grab and immobilize their prey.",
            "When attempting to fight such a creature, a witcher should drink the Golden Oriole potion beforehand and then attack from a safe distance with a crossbow before dealing the finishing blows with a silver sword coated with insectoid oil."
