Yrden can be used to slow the bear down just enough to make it easier on you to evade their paws.",

            "A drowner, also known as muire d'yaeblen in Skellige, resembles a corpse dredged from the bottom of a pond. It is sickly blue or green in color, with slime and sludge oozing out of every pore and the acrid stench of rot wafting off of it.",
            "It is often thought that drowners arise from the bodies of those who have drowned in shallow water. Like so many other beliefs about monsters, this one is false. While drowners do look like humans from a distance, witchers, who have the dubious pleasure of examining them from close quarters, have reported the numerous ways in which their anatomy differs from our own. Their scaly skin, gills and dorsal fins suggest drowners and their like are an entirely foreign species.",
            "Cowardly creatures by nature, they usually stick to eating scraps they dig out of rubbish piles and animal carcasses. Yet if a lone traveler or careless fisherman strays into their territory, they turn from scavengers to fearsome predators."

            "These creatures are particularly active at dusk and during the night, especially if the rain is falling – at such times they will even leave their watery homes and venture inland.",
            "Drowners live in putrid, rotting filth, and so have developed a high resistance to poison. Though humanoid in form, they are primitive creatures no more intelligent than carp or pike. That is why spells affecting the mind, the Axii sign included, are ineffective against them. Yet they are particularly vulnerable to magic drawn from the element of fire, including the Igni sign."

            "These creatures have powerful arms and claws like Zerrikanian kinjals, yet what makes them truly dangerous is their mastery of deception, beguilement and disorientation. Many times they need not attack at all, instead simply driving their prey to madness or into boggy marshlands, after which they wait patiently for it to drown in the muddy waters."
